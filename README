Welcome to the INFAMOUS Plugins README

Things are just firing up. So far we have exactly 1 plugins. But hey, its gettin there right?


To install, make sure you have the dependencies and then just run the script install.sh:
    chmod 700 install.sh
    ./install.sh
    
    
This will ask for your password several times using gksudo, so be prepaired. Once its complete all the plugins will be installed in the correct directory to be used by your favorite LV2 host. There are also several utilities generated in the utils/ folder that must be executed locally.

Dependencies:
    qmake
    lv2-dev
    gksudo

Now lets talk about what you're installing:

==========================================
1. Cellular Automaton Synth

This synthesizer plugin is an additive synthesizer, where 16 harmonics are added according to rules of elementary cellular automata. A rule is created and determines whether a cell will survive, die, or be created based on its previous state and its neighbors. Thus a harmonic will either play or be silent according to its associated cell's state. The 16 cells are on a torus where the ends wrap around to meet, therefore the highest harmonic influences the state of the first harmonic. This synth has no filter, so harmonics must be controlled through the rule and initial condition. To assist in your sound design there is a command line utility included called rule that will print out the cell states in sequence (see rule on line 53). For more information regarding Cellular Automaton in general read wikipedia under Elementary Cellular Automaton.

It is unlimitedly polyphonic and has 2 LFOs. It also features an ADBSSR envelope generator for the amplitude envelope.

Parameter Description:
    CHANNEL - Midi channel, set to 0 for all channels
    MASTER_GAIN - total volume
    RULE - rule for determining next state in cellular automaton
    CELL_LIFE - length between cell states
    INIT_CELLS - initial condition of cells when a note is played
    NHARMONICS - number of harmonics added in
    HARM_MODE - determines gains of the harmonics 
    WAVE - basic Waveform of the harmonics
    ENV_A - attack time
    ENV_D - decay time
    ENV_B - break point gain (to switch between decay and swell)
    ENV_SWL - swell time
    ENV_SUS - sustain gain
    ENV_R - release time
    AMOD_WAV - amplitude modulation waveform
    AMOD_FREQ - amplitude modulation frequency
    AMOD_GAIN - amplitude modulation gain
    FMOD_WAV - frequency modulation waveform
    FMOD_FREQ - frequency modulation frequency
    FMOD_GAIN - frequency modulation gain




==========================================
2. rule

This visulizes cell automata on a torus. Run it by opening a terminal, navigating to the utils folder and run 

    ./rule <rule number> <initial condition>
    
The least significant digit corresponds to the first harmonic.
